// An agent that runs on another machine, in a pane you can watch.
//
// The coordinator can already place a whole project's work on whichever host
// happens to have it, which is the right answer when any machine will do. It
// is the wrong answer when a specific one is the point: tests want the Mac,
// a build may want the Linux box, and a team is often both at once — a leader
// here and one member over there.
//
// That is a property of the member, not of the team, so it is attached one
// agent at a time. The pane is local: a peer surface is attached into this
// workspace, so `panelId` still addresses it and everything keyed on that —
// delegating, reading the reply off the scrollback, revealing it — works
// without knowing the agent is somewhere else.
